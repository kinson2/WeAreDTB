Our next dance party is this Saturday October 19, 2024. Christopher CK Kinson is the featured DJ at this month's dance party at Gallery Art Bar. 

Friend and DJ, Norman Hernandez of [kuumbaradio](https://www.instagram.com/kuumbaradio/), will open at 8:00pm-10:00pm. Check out his [SoundCloud page](https://soundcloud.com/user-841755128?ref=clipboard&p=i&c=1&si=9840396AF57F414C9E1A7CA3DA9EFA71&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) with many of his archived mixes.

CK will go on at 10:00pm-2:00am. CK plans on playing a little bit of everything - R&B, jazz, funk, soul, and disco - and any of their subgenres and regional spinoffs. It's going to be a wild ride and we hope you are comfortable joining us on the journey and on the dance floor.

Join us for a great time and support the bar with drinks, snacks, and tips. Make the dance floor your destination!
