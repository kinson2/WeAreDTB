Saturday, February 15, 2025, we're having our second dance party of the year! The theme we seem to be connected with is "Keep Hope Alive", which certainly reflects the revolutionary conviction we must have amidst outrageous political actions. We'll see you on the dance floor at Gallery Art Bar Saturday Feb. 15, 2025 8:00 pm - 1:00 am. Spinning the danciest tunes will be DJ MixZN, CK, and BLACKSTAR. Join us for a great time and support the bar with drinks, snacks, and tips. 

There's still some DTB t-shirts for sale: one shirt for $15 or two shirts for $25. Let any one of the djs know that you want a shirt.
