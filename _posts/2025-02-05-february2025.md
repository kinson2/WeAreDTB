Saturday, February 15, 2025, we're having our second dance party of the year! The theme we seem to be connected with is "Keep Hope Alive", which certainly reflects the revolutionary conviction we must have amidst outrageous executive orders. Bring your loves and capacity to love with you to Gallery Art Bar on Saturday Feb. 15, 2025 8:00 pm - 1:00 am. Spinning the danciest tunes will be DJ MIXZN, CK, and BLACKSTAR. Join us for a great time and support the bar with drinks, snacks, and tips. 

We have several DTB t-shirts for sale: one shirt for $15 or two shirts for $20.
