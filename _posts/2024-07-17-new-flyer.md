Here's an updated flyer for our monthly Darker Than Blue events! Each month, weâ€™ll feature a member of the collective who will spin for most of the night. Our next dance party is this Saturday July 20, 2024. Stacey BLACKSTAR Robinson and Christopher CK Kinson are opening up at 8:00-10:00pm. Joe E-squared Blanks is the featured DJ Saturday July 20 at Gallery Art Bar. He'll go on at 10:00pm-1:00am. Join us for a great time and support the bar with drinks, snacks, and tips. Make the dance floor your destination!
