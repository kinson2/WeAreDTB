Our next dance party is this Saturday September 28, 2024. Warren MIXZN is the featured DJ at this month's dance party at Gallery Art Bar. A first for us (and dare I say Chambana!), three women are going to DJ that night - Venus the Fly Trap at 8:00 pm, Carlie Upchurch at 9:00 pm, and Sparr at 12:00 am. MIXZN will go on at 10:00pm-12:00am. Join us for a great time and support the bar with drinks, snacks, and tips. Make the dance floor your destination!
