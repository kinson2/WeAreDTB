We're entering the season of giving and gratitude.

November is going to very special to Darker Than Blue. It marks our one-year anniversary of existence. In celebration of that, we're doing something we've never done before. We're having a funky dance party + donation drive for a local food bank. We want folks to bring a canned food item as their entry fee to our event at Gallery Art Bar on November 16, 2024 8pm-2am. The stench will be loud since we're playing that funky music! A funk music dance party is what Urbana needs right now. Dress in your funkiest digs. Roll your curls. Pick your afro. Spritz your locs. It's going to be hot hot hot!

Another reason to celebrate...we have new DTB t-shirts for sale: one shirt for $15 or two shirts for $25. 

We'll see you on the dance floor at Gallery Art Bar Saturday Nov. 16, 2024. Maybe there will be a fashion show for who wore the funkiest outfit? Join us for a great time and support the bar with drinks, snacks, and tips. Bring your canned food item. If that's not feasible, then donate funds to [Cunningham Township](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=WX8MFCBFH9YGJ&source=url).
