Each month, we’ll feature a member of the collective who will spin for most of the night. We’re featuring Kamau "KamauMau" Grantham on Friday August 23 at Gallery Art Bar at 8:00pm-1:00am. Stacey "BLACKSTAR" Robinson and Warren "Mixzn" Smith are opening up at 8:00pm-10:00pm. KamauMau spins at 10:00pm. Join us for a great time and support the bar with drinks, snacks, and tips. Make the dance floor your destination!

On Saturday August 31 6:00pm-10:00pm at Gallery Art Bar’s outdoor space, DTB is spinning party vibes for Labor Day weekend. Hangout with us Saturday and have something to talk about on your three-day weekend.
