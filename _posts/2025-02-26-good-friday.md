We're trying something new this year. We wanted to explore subgenres of house music that get a lot of love on the dance floor elsewhere in decades past. We want to have a dance party where we spin all gospel house, spiritual house, and soulful house music.

And to be fully transparent, this is not a religious dance party. House music is for everyone everywhere. We welcome all people - whether you believe in something or nothing at all. We want to share in the joy, fun, invigoration of spiritual house music and gospel house music.

The bass and sound system will hover around 122 beats per minute all night long. Come ready to dance, sweat, and move your body in all ways fathomable.

We'll see you on the dance floor at 8:00 pm at Channing-Murray Foundation, located at 1209 W Oregon St in Urbana, IL. The party is over at 10:00 pm, so don't miss it. This is a free event!
