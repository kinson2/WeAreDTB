We're bringing back Create + Chill as a seasonal event series at the Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center located at 202 S. Broadway Ave, Urbana, IL 61801.

Create+Chill is centered around working, creating art, and just hanging out in a diy environment. This space is safe for Black folks and welcoming to everyone, and we encourage all ages including families with children to come through and get some adult talking to another adult time. Someone else maybe works remotely and wants to get a little extra work done, because we know it doesnâ€™t always get done Monday-Friday. Maybe an artist wants to finish a piece in the company of other artists. Or someone really just wants to listen and dance to good music. 

On Saturday, May 10, 2025, 2:00-5:00pm, there will be tabletop board games, card games, and puzzles. Bring your favorites or work on your own artistic creations.

On Saturday, July 12, 2025, 2:00-5:00pm, we're partnering with CU BIPOC Artist Collective. There will be collage materials and art supplies for a guided activity. Again, you have freedom to do your own artistic endeavors.

On Saturday, October 25, 2025, 12:00-2:30pm, there will be a turntable, mixer, and dj controller. Bring your favorite records and laptops for making beats. Or work on your own art.
