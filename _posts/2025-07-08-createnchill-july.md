Our next Create + Chill event is Saturday, July 11, 2025 2:00-5:00 pm at the Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center located at 202 S. Broadway Ave, Urbana, IL 61801.

Create+Chill is centered around working, creating art, and just hanging out in a diy environment. This space is safe for Black folks and welcoming to everyone, and we encourage all ages including families with children to come through and get some adult talking to another adult time. Someone else maybe works remotely and wants to get a little extra work done, because we know it doesnâ€™t always get done Monday-Friday. Maybe an artist wants to finish a piece in the company of other artists. Or someone really just wants to listen and dance to good music. 

We're partnering with CU BIPOC Artist Collective. There will be collage materials and art supplies for a guided activity. Again, you have freedom to do your own artistic endeavors.
