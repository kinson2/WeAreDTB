Each month, we’ll feature a member of the collective who will spin for most of the night. We’re featuring Stacey BLACKSTAR Robinson on Friday August 23, our first DTB party of the summer, at Gallery Art Bar at 8:00pm – 1:00am. A couple of us in the collective will open up for BLACKSTAR, but he's the headliner. Join us for a great time and support the bar with drinks, snacks, and tips.
